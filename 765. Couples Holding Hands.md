# 765. Couples Holding Hands

## 问题描述

N couples sit in 2N seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands. We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side. A *swap* consists of choosing **any** two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

The people and seats are represented by an integer from `0` to `2N-1`, the couples are numbered in order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and so on with the last couple being `(2N-2, 2N-1)`.

The couples' initial seating is given by `row[i]` being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the i-th seat.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: row = [0, 2, 1, 3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: row = [3, 2, 0, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All couples are already seated side by side.
```

**Note:**

1. `len(row)` is even and in the range of `[4, 60]`.
2. `row` is guaranteed to be a permutation of `0...len(row)-1`.

/**
 * @param {number[]} row
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSwapsCouples = function (row) {
  let res = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < row.length; i += 2) {
    let mate
    if (row[i] % 2 === 0) {
      mate = row[i] + 1
    } else {
      mate = row[i] - 1
    }
    if (row[i + 1] === mate) continue
    res++
    for (let j = i + 2; j < row.length; j++) {
      if (row[j] === mate) {
        [row[i + 1], row[j]] = [row[j], row[i + 1]]
        break
      }
    }
  }
  return res
}
```

思路就是遍历每一对``[a,b]``，如果``a``与``b``正好配对，则跳过；若``a``与``b``不匹配，则向后查找与``a``匹配的，然后与``b``交换，并且交换次数加1。
