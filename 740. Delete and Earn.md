# 740. Delete and Earn

## 问题描述

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return *the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## 思路

先把每个数字的和加起来，然后按数字顺序遍历，求不相邻的数字和的最大值。本题也可以用带排序的map来做，可惜JavaScript中的map是unordered的。

## 解决

JavaScript语言描述：

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var deleteAndEarn = function (nums) {
  let arr = Array(10001).fill(0)
  for (let n of nums) {
    arr[n]+=n
  }
  let pre = 0, cur = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < 10001; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === 0) {
      pre = cur
      cur += arr[i]
    } else {
      [pre, cur] = [cur, Math.max(pre + arr[i], cur)]
    }
  }
  return cur
}
```
