# 198. House Robber

## 问题描述

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var rob = function (nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) {
    return 0
  }
  if (nums.length === 1) {
    return nums[0]
  }
  let dp = []
  let sum = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])
  dp[0] = nums[0]
  dp[1] = sum
  for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])
    sum = Math.max(sum, dp[i])
  }
  return sum
}
```

思路
$$
F(i)=\max(F(i-1),F(i-2)+nums[i])
$$

$$
sum=\max(sum,F(i))
$$
