# 684. Redundant Connection

## 问题描述

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the graph.

Return *an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of* `n` *nodes*. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == edges.length`
- `3 <= n <= 1000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= a_i < b_i <= edges.length`
- `a_i != b_i`
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

## 思路

本题的关键是建立一个关联。关联的方法就是找到一个公共的父节点。如果新加入的元素和已有元素有公共的父节点，那么就会形成环，这是需要把这条边删除。

## 解决

JavaScript语言描述：

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findRedundantConnection = function (edges) {
  let p = []
  for (let i = 0; i <= edges.length; i++) {
    p.push(i)
  }
  for (let e of edges) {
    let a = e[0], b = e[1]
    while (a != p[a]) a = p[a]
    while (b != p[b]) b = p[b]
    if (a === b) {
      return e
    } else {
      p[b] = a
    }
  }
}
```
