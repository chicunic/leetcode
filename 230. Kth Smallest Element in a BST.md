# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

## 问题描述

Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th smallest element in it.

**Note:** 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

**Follow up:**
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
