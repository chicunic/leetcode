# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## 问题描述

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## 思路

遍历数组，用变量``min``存经过的最小的数，``profit``存当前数与最小数的差的最大值。遍历结束后返回``profit``。

## 解决

JavaScript语言描述：

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let min = prices[0], profit = 0
  for (let i of prices) {
      if (i < min) {
          min = i
          continue
      }
      if (profit < i - min) {
          profit = i - min
      }
  }
  return profit
}
```
