# 486. Predict the Winner

## 问题描述

You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`

## 思路

由于不管怎么取，最终所有的数都会取完，所以两人得到的数之和是固定的。因此可以用一个递归函数模拟取数，如果是player1取数则加上，player2取数则减去，最终判断结果大于等于0则返回`true`，否则返回`false`。

## 解决

C++语言描述：

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool PredictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
        return recursive(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1) >= 0;
    }

    int recursive(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right) {
        if (left == right) {
            return nums[left];
        }
        else {
            int chooseLeft = nums[left] - recursive(nums, left + 1, right);
            int chooseRight = nums[right] - recursive(nums, left, right - 1);
            return max(chooseLeft, chooseRight);
        }
    }
};
```

Java语言描述：

```java

```

JavaScript语言描述：

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var PredictTheWinner = function (nums) {
  return recursive(nums, 0, nums.length - 1) >= 0
}

let recursive = function (nums, left, right) {
  if (left === right) {
    return nums[left]
  } else {
    let chooseLeft = nums[left] - recursive(nums, left + 1, right)
    let chooseRight = nums[right] - recursive(nums, left, right - 1)
    return Math.max(chooseLeft, chooseRight)
  }
}
```
