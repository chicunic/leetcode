# 765. Couples Holding Hands

## 问题描述

There are `n` couples sitting in `2n` seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.

The people and seats are represented by an integer array `row` where `row[i]` is the ID of the person sitting in the `i^th` seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and so on with the last couple being `(2n - 2, 2n - 1)`.

Return *the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side*. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: row = [0,2,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: row = [3,2,0,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All couples are already seated side by side.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2n == row.length`
- `2 <= n <= 30`
- `n` is even.
- `0 <= row[i] < 2n`
- All the elements of `row` are **unique**.

## 思路

思路就是遍历每一对`[a,b]`，如果`a`与`b`正好配对，则跳过；若`a`与`b`不匹配，则向后查找与`a`匹配的，然后与`b`交换，并且交换次数加1。

## 解决

JavaScript语言描述：

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} row
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSwapsCouples = function (row) {
  let res = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < row.length; i += 2) {
    let mate
    if (row[i] % 2 === 0) {
      mate = row[i] + 1
    } else {
      mate = row[i] - 1
    }
    if (row[i + 1] === mate) continue
    res++
    for (let j = i + 2; j < row.length; j++) {
      if (row[j] === mate) {
        [row[i + 1], row[j]] = [row[j], row[i + 1]]
        break
      }
    }
  }
  return res
}
```
