# 791. Custom Sort String

## 问题描述

`S` and `T` are strings composed of lowercase letters. In `S`, no letter occurs more than once.

`S` was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of `T` so that they match the order that `S` was sorted. More specifically, if `x` occurs before `y` in `S`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the returned string.

Return any permutation of `T` (as a string) that satisfies this property.

```
Example :
Input: 
S = "cba"
T = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: 
"a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
```

 

**Note:**

- `S` has length at most `26`, and no character is repeated in `S`.
- `T` has length at most `200`.
- `S` and `T` consist of lowercase letters only.

/**
 * @param {string} S
 * @param {string} T
 * @return {string}
 */
var customSortString = function (S, T) {
  let m = {}
  for (let i = 0; i < S.length; i++) {
    m[S.charAt(i)] = i;
  }
  // console.log(m)
  let sortLetters = function (a, b) {
    let ma = m[a]
    let mb = m[b]
    if(ma === undefined) ma = -1
    if(mb === undefined) mb = -1
    return ma - mb
  }
  return T.split('').sort(sortLetters).join('')
}
```

利用字符串S创建一个对象，属性名为字母，属性值为在S中的位置。然后自定义一个比较函数，利用这个函数进行排序。注意对不在S中的值要进行特殊处理。
