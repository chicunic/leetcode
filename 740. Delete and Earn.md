# 740. Delete and Earn

## 问题描述

Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete **every**element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
```

**Note:**

The length of `nums` is at most `20000`.

Each element `nums[i]` is an integer in the range `[1, 10000]`.

JavaScript语言描述：

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var deleteAndEarn = function (nums) {
  let arr = Array(10001).fill(0)
  for (let n of nums) {
    arr[n]+=n
  }
  let pre = 0, cur = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < 10001; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === 0) {
      pre = cur
      cur += arr[i]
    } else {
      [pre, cur] = [cur, Math.max(pre + arr[i], cur)]
    }
  }
  return cur
}

```

先把每个数字的和加起来，然后按数字顺序遍历，求不相邻的数字和的最大值。本题也可以用带排序的map来做，可惜JavaScript中的map是unordered的。
